"This article reports on research that investigates how websites
containing user-generated content (UGC) are used by consumers
and the role they have on their information search and travel
behavior" pg.743, 1st phrg

"UGC (or Web 2.0 sites, as they are also known)
appear to act as an additional source of information that travelers
consider as part of their information search process, rather than as
the only source of information" pg.743, 1st phrg

"Existing research on the process of selecting a travel destination, or planning a
leisure holiday, has tended to follow the general consumer decision-making
model which proposes five key stages (Engel, Blackwell, & Miniard, 1990;" pg.744, 4th phrg

"Jeng and Fesenmaier (2002) note that travelers generally collect
and review various forms of travel information early in the travel decision making
process in order to minimize the risk of making a poor destination decision." pg.745, 1st phrg

"Research to date has demonstrated that consumers use different
types of online information sources depending on where they are at in the
travel planning process—that is the pretrip, during trip and posttrip stages
(Choi et al., 2007; Seabra, Abrantes, & Lages, 2007)." pg.745, 2nd phrg

"travel consumers tend to seek information related
to 10 key subdecisions regarding the trip—travel partners; the destination;
expenditure required; activities; travel dates; attractions to visit; transportation
providers; length of trip; rest stops; and food stops." pg.745, 2nd phrg

"The Internet is now a particularly critical source of information for prospective
travelers when they are in the research phase (i.e. information search) of
the travel planning process (Pan & Fesenmaier, 2006; Xiang & Fesenmaier, 2006)." pg.746, 2nd phrg

"Approximately 95% of Internet users rely on information from the web as part of
their travel information search process (Plog research cited in Pan & Fesenmaier, 2006, p. 810)." pg.746, 2nd phrg
