quotes:

"The results showed that motivating visuals and trip information
functionality were significant predictors of Web site usefulness.
Web site usefulness was a significant predictor of
intent to travel to the destination, whereas previous visits to
the destination or its Web site had significant but small negative
influence on intentions to travel. The motivating visuals
factor was also a significant direct predictor of intentions to
travel to the destination, whereas trip information functionality
had indirect influence on intentions through Web site
usefulness." pag.1, 1st prg

"Vogt, Fesenmaier, and MacKay (1993) and Vogt and
Fesenmaier (1998) found the top reason for collecting information
is destination choice and planning a trip to a destination." pag.2, 4th prg
