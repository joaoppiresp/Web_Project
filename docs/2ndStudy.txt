quotes:

"In tourism, consumers' behaviour has always been influenced by developments in Information Comunication Technologies
(Buhalis, 1998; Poon, 1993), and especially it is Web 2.0 that dramatically changed how consumers plan
and consume travel related products (Buhalis & Law, 2008)." pag.1, 2nd prg
